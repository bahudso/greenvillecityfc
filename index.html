      <h2>ABOUT THE TEAM</h2>
      <img src="pics/futsal.jpg" id="futsal"/>
      <p>Greenville City is a football club based in the Greenville/Spartanburg
      area. We play in adult leagues through the <a href="http://www.upwardstarcenter.com/soccer">Upward Star Center</a>.</p>

      <p>Pictured to the left is our team from Upward Star Center's 2016 Futsal
      league in which we won season champions.</p>

      <p>We are currently playing at the Upward Star Center, between Greenville and Spartanburg. Wednesday nights we play in an 11v11 league with a full field, full goals, and 3 referees. This is a new Rec league (Upward also has a Premier league for more advanced play). The field surface is artificial turf and is the best in the area - no uneven grass with divots or flooded with water. The games are played rain or shine (except thunder/lightning). Most people in Greenville think the Upward Center is too far of a drive - it is not. It is right off of 85, exit 66. To give a better idea of distance, 85 and 385 is exit 51 and 85 and Pelham is exit 54.</p>

      <p>Other benefits of the Upward league is that there are no player cards. Each player on the roster creates an account with Upward and then joins their team, through a team code. When each player joins their team, they pay a team fee, significantly easing the load on the team captain who usually pays a large amount at once. All of the team members then pitch in and split the referee fees for the season. It's that simple. And not a pain... If there are any roster issues, there is always a field rep who can check the official roster against player identification.</p>
